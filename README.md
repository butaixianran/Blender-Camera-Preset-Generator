# Install
* Install the .zip file you get from online shop.
* Search "`Camera Preset Generator`" in your addon list and enable it

# How to use
## Create Camera Motion
* Select a category, pick a preset, click "`Generate Camera`" button.
* You can search presets with filter, supporting multiple keywords

## Auto Switch Camera
* Generate multiple cameras with this addon.  
* Click "`Auto Switch Camera`" button at the bottom of this addon's panel.  

Auto Switch only works for camera systems generated by this addon. You can manually move or rotate any items of a camera system, it will still work. Just do not change a camera system's structure.  

## Create preset
* Click Save button.  

## Create preset thumbnail image
* Click "`Generate Path`" button at the bottom of this addon. It will generate a path of your camera.
* Go to "`View`" menu at the top of viewport, select "**Viewport Render Image**", render this camera path into an image.
* Save this image with the same name of your preset, into the same folder. 

## Load Preset
* When using "`Load`" button, You can pick thumbnail image to load a preset.  

## Modify Category or add preset to Category
* Go to addon's preset folder
  * on windows, it could be: "`%AppData%\Blender Foundation\Blender\Your Blender Version\scripts\addons\CameraPresetGenerator\preset`"
* Any folder here, will be load as a category.
* Any preset file in a category folder, will be displayed in the preview list

# Tip
### General
* There is a default preset in "`User`" category. You can use it to reset addon panel's setting.  

* **When selecting a category, there is no default preset selected for.** You need to select one.    

* Preset data is load onto addon's UI panel at the moment you selected it.    

* Choose a preset similar to the shot you want, then move it manually, can achieve the shot you need most efficiently. Only adjust settings on addon panel when you need your own preset.  


### Create thumbnail image
* If a preset doesn't have a thumbnail image, addon will use a default image. So you actually don't have to create a thumbnail image.  
* When loading a preset with "`Load`" button, you can pick a thumbnail image to import the preset.

# Camera System
This addon creates a camera system with: a Camera, a Target, a Revolve Sun, and a Handler for the whole system.  
![preset](img/screenshot/addon_cam_sys.jpg)  


* **Camera:** you can move or rotate it as you want  

* **Revolve Sun:** rotate it, camera will rotate around it.  

* **Empty Target:** If "`Look at target`" is checked and `Target Type` is set to "`Empty`" on addon panel, camera will always look at this empty target.   
  * **This is very useful, when you want to track a moving object which keeps shaking, but you still want to keep your camera stable.**    

* **Handler:** Empty parent for the whole system. So you can adjust camera motion as a whole.

# Setting
### Position and Rotation
A generated camera motion can have 3 key frames:
* **Start frame**  
Those vector properties on addon panel are not coordinates and final angles. They are distance and rotation angles about how much you want to move or rotate it based on **default transform**.  

* **End frame**: Can be set after checking "`Has Motion`".  
Those vector properties on addon panel are not coordinates and final angles. They are distance and rotation angles about how much you want to move or rotate it based on **start frame**.  


* **Middle frame**: Can be set after checking "`Set Middle Point`".  
Those vector properties on addon panel are not coordinates and final angles. They are distance and rotation angles about how much you want to move or rotate it based on **start frame**.  





### Shot Duration
**Unit is in second**, addon will convert it into frame numbers based on project's fps setting.  



### Look At Target Type
If "`Look At Target`" is checked, generated camera will always looking at the target object you selected here:  
* **Empty**: Generated empty target object, whose start position is same as empty sun.
* **Object**: The object you picked into "`Target`" property. If "`Target Bone`" is checked, the bone you selected will be the target to look at.  

### Handler Position:
Set position of camera system's handler. Default is `In-Between`, means it is at the middle of the camera and the empty sun object.  

### Auto Switch Camera
Switch point will be every camera motion's end frame.  

The order of your camera is based on camera motion's start frame.  

For example, I have:  
camera motion 01 from frame 100-300  
camera motion 02 from frame 600-900  

Then, camera motion will start with camera 01. And swtich to camera 02 at frame 300. But there is no motion on camera 02 at this frame, until you play timeline to frame 600.    

So, to set multiple camera motions, you need to set a start frame and end frame for each camera motion. Just like any other camera motion.   

Preset has already set camera motion length for you, so you just pick each camera's start frame.   

So, you just change "**Start frame**" option's value to "**current frame**" at addon panel, then go to the start frame you like to generate a camera.  

You can also set "**Start frame**" to "**Follow Last Camera**"(new in version 1.1). So, new camera motion's start frame, will be last camera motion's end frame+1.  

**If you have multiple camera system, you may want to view all camera motions' range at once. You can do that by going to Blender's NLA view.**  

NLA is a must learn thing, if you use blender for animation. Search "Blender NLA" for more. 

Do not click "Push Down Action" button in NLA. Once you do that, camera will have no action anymore. Then this auto switch won't work.  



#### Switch method
Each method handles **fixed shot** in a different way.   
A **fixed shot**, is a camera only has start frame, no end frame.  

For **merge** method, if a camera is a fixed shot, it will use next camera's start frame number as switch point. So, this fixed shot is merged into camera motions.   

For **follow** method, if a camera is a fixed shot, it will use the "**fixed shot duration**" you set on addon panel, to calculate the end frame number of this fixed shot, and use that end point as switch point to next camera.
