# Tip
### General
* There is a default preset in "`User`" category. You can use it to reset addon panel's setting.  

* Check preset's name on addon panel, to know which preset you selected.   

* Choose a preset similar to the shot you want, then move it manually, can achieve the shot you need most efficiently. Only adjust settings on addon panel when you need your own preset.  

### Create thumbnail image
* Blender's preview image works best with square ratio.
* If a preset doesn't have a thumbnail image, addon will use a default image. So you actually don't have to create a thumbnail image.  

# Camera System
This addon creates a camera system with: a Camera, a Target, a Revolve Sun, and a Handler for the whole system.  
![preset](img/screenshot/addon_cam_sys.jpg)  


* **Camera:** you can move or rotate it as you want  

* **Revolve Sun:** rotate it, camera will rotate around it.  

* **Empty Target:** If "`Look at target`" is checked and `Target Type` is set to "`Empty`" on addon panel, camera will always look at this empty target.   
  * **This is very useful, when you want to track a moving object which keeps shaking, but you still want to keep your camera stable.**    

* **Handler:** Empty parent for the whole system. So you can adjust camera motion as a whole.

# Setting
### Position and Rotation
A generated camera motion can have 3 key frames:
* **Start frame**  
Those vector properties on addon panel are not coordinates and final angles. They are distance and rotation angles about how much you want to move or rotate it based on **default transform**.  

* **End frame**: Can be set after checking "`Has Motion`".  
Those vector properties on addon panel are not coordinates and final angles. They are distance and rotation angles about how much you want to move or rotate it based on **start frame**.  


* **Middle frame**: Can be set after checking "`Set Middle Point`".  
Those vector properties on addon panel are not coordinates and final angles. They are distance and rotation angles about how much you want to move or rotate it based on **start frame**.
